### Morning: Backend Exam

Please **choose one option** only. The idea is to let everyone start at a level that matches their current backend skills.

- [Option 1: Level 5 Exam ](./material/exam-l5.md) designed for students who already have solid backend experience and want to aim for a higher grade. Choose this option if you are **comfortable** with:
  - Express  
  - Node.js  
  - MongoDB  
  - AI

- [Option 2: Level 1 Exam (basic pass level)](./material/exam-l1.md): This exam ensures you can **pass the Backend part of the course** even if you are still learning the fundamentals. 
  - Choose this option if you are **not yet confident** with backend development.  
  - If you start with **Level 1**, you can take a **similar higher‑level exam later** to improve your grade once you feel ready.
